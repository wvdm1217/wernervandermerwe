## Getting Started

To get started with the codebase, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/wvdm1217/wernervandermerwe.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Customize the content and configuration to suit your blog:

- Update the blog posts in the `content/posts` directory.
- Modify the configuration in the `.vitepress/config.js` file to reflect your preferences.
- Add or modify any other pages or components as needed.

4. Start the local development server:

   ```shell
   npm run docs:dev
   ```

This will start a local development server and provide you with a URL where you can preview your blog.

## Deployment

To deploy your programming blog on Microsoft Azure, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an Azure account (if you haven't already) and install the Azure CLI.

2. Create an Azure Web App using the Azure CLI and configure it as per the instructions in the [deployment section](#deployment) of the assistant's response.

3. Build your Vitepress website locally and deploy it to Azure using the provided Azure remote repository.
