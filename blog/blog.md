# Introduction

This is the space I want to use to build and share ideas related to my career and interests.
Topics covered will include machine learning, software development and cloud computing.
This site will most likely change over the years as I go through the usual cycle of not wanting to work on old code.
My hope is this does not become a dormant mess of scribbles that has not been touched in years.

## Guidelines

- Write the blog posts yourself, this is a space to form coherent ideas, not too get AI to do it for me.
- Build things that interest me and then share it with the world and hope it interests them. 
- Success is measured by the energy I take out of the work not the energy I put into it.
